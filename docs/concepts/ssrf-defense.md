# SSRF Defense

Kreuzcrawl refuses outbound HTTP requests targeting internal infrastructure,
cloud metadata endpoints, and unsupported schemes. The policy is on by
default and applies to every crawl, scrape, sitemap fetch, robots.txt fetch,
asset download, and link-following enqueue.

## What is refused

| Category | Ranges |
|----------|--------|
| Loopback | 127.0.0.0/8, ::1 |
| Private (RFC1918) | 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16 |
| Link-local | 169.254.0.0/16 (incl. AWS/GCP metadata 169.254.169.254), fe80::/10 |
| Unspecified | 0.0.0.0/8 |
| Multicast | 224.0.0.0/4, ff00::/8 |
| IPv6 unique-local | fc00::/7 |
| Non-http/https schemes | file, ftp, gopher, … |

DNS rebinding is mitigated: if a hostname resolves to a mix of public and
denied IPs, the request is refused.

Each 30x `Location` is re-resolved and re-validated against the same policy
before the next hop is taken. Up to `SsrfPolicy::max_redirects` (default 5)
hops are followed.

## Opting out

Two equivalent paths:

**Environment variable** — applies to every crawler in the process:

```bash
export KREUZCRAWL_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK=1
```

**Per-config builder** — applies to a single CrawlConfig:

```rust
use kreuzcrawl::CrawlConfigBuilder;

let config = CrawlConfigBuilder::default()
    .allow_private_networks(true)
    .build();
```

When opt-out is on, the policy permits private IPs but **still refuses
non-http(s) schemes**. The redirect cap and per-hop re-validation also stay
in effect.

## Host allowlists

Allowlist specific hosts while keeping the rest of the policy strict:

```rust
use kreuzcrawl::{CrawlConfigBuilder, HostMatcher};

let config = CrawlConfigBuilder::default()
    .ssrf_allowlist_host(HostMatcher::Suffix(".internal.kreuzberg.dev".into()))
    .ssrf_allowlist_host(HostMatcher::Cidr("10.42.0.0/16".into()))
    .build();
```

| Matcher | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `Exact("api.example.com")` | the exact hostname, case-insensitive |
| `Suffix(".example.com")` | `api.example.com`, `example.com` — but **not** `notexample.com` |
| `Cidr("10.42.0.0/16")` | resolved IPs inside the CIDR; also permits literal-IP URLs whose IP is inside |

Allowlist entries permit access regardless of the default denylist. A
mismatch between hostname allowlist and resolved IPs (e.g. `Exact("svc.internal")`
resolves to a public IP) still permits the request — the allowlist trusts the host string.

## What happens when a request is refused

Errors are typed:

```rust
pub enum CrawlError {
    SsrfPolicyViolation { url: String, reason: String },
    /* … */
}
```

`url` is the refused URL (original input or the redirect target that failed).
`reason` is one of `"loopback"`, `"private_network"`, `"link_local"`,
`"unique_local"`, `"multicast"`, `"unspecified"`, or `"disallowed scheme: <scheme>"`.

The default retry policy classifies `SsrfPolicyViolation` as permanent —
the crawler will not retry the request.

For link-following inside the crawl loop, refused targets are dropped from
the queue and a `tracing::warn!` is emitted with structured fields
(`url`, `reason`) so operators can see what was blocked.

## Browser layer parity

The headless browser layer (`kreuzcrawl-browser`) shares the same policy core
and applies it to every JS-initiated `fetch()` and every navigation. Two
browser-specific extras are kept:

- `file://` is permitted in the browser process so test pages can use local
  fixtures.
- A `localhost`/`.localhost` string short-circuit runs before DNS to mitigate
  rebinding through the browser's resolver.

This is the same mitigation chain that fixed GHSA-8v6v-g4rh-jmcm.
