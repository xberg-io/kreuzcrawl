## Setup

Rust 1.95 is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`. Clone and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xberg-io/crawlberg
cd crawlberg
cargo build
```

`rustup` will fetch 1.95 on first run if you don't have it. Most Rust work is under `crates/crawlberg/`.

### Pre-commit

Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) once, then wire up both hook types:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type commit-msg
```

It runs automatically on `git commit`. To run it by hand:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Feature flags

The default build enables `native-runtime` outside wasm32. Add optional features as needed:

| Feature              | What it adds                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `native-runtime`     | Native OS runtime marker, enabled by default            |
| `browser`            | Chromiumoxide browser backend                           |
| `browser-native`     | In-process native browser backend                       |
| `ai`                 | LLM extraction via liter-llm                            |
| `api`                | REST API server via Axum                                |
| `mcp`                | Model Context Protocol server                           |
| `mcp-http`           | MCP over HTTP (implies `mcp` + `api`)                   |
| `telemetry-init`     | OpenTelemetry/OTLP initialization helpers               |
| `interact`           | Compatibility alias for browser-backed page interaction |
| `warc`               | WARC archive output                                     |

```bash
cargo build --features api,mcp
```

`interact()` is always part of the public API. Runtime support depends on the compiled browser backend:
chromiumoxide performs the actions, native performs supported actions in-process, and builds without a browser
backend return `Unsupported`.

## Tests

To run all tests across the workspace (this includes both unit tests and integration tests, which may hit the network):

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

To run _only_ the integration test binaries:

```bash
cargo test --workspace --test '*'
```

Browser tests need a running Chrome instance. Docker is the least painful way:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
cargo test --features browser --test browser_tests
```

CI treats clippy warnings as errors, so run this before pushing:

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --all-features --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

## Code conventions

Formatting is configured in `rustfmt.toml`. `cargo fmt` (or the pre-commit hook) handles it.

Four things that aren't obvious from the code:

- Async runtime is `tokio`. Don't introduce `async-std` or `smol`.
- Public API types belong in `crates/crawlberg/src/types/`. Internal types live next to the code that uses them.
- `defaults/` is `pub(crate)`. Don't re-export from it at the crate root without a discussion — the narrow public surface is intentional.
- Error types go in `error.rs` with `thiserror`. No `anyhow` in library code.

## Commits

[gitfluff](https://github.com/Goldziher/gitfluff) lints commit messages on commit. Format:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`. Scope is the crate or area — `engine`, `api`, `cli`, `python`, etc.

Good example: `fix(engine): respect max_pages limit during batch crawl`

## Pull requests

Branch from `main` using `<type>/<short-description>` — e.g. `feat/streaming-results` or `fix/rate-limiter-overflow`.

Before opening:

1. `cargo fmt --all`
2. `cargo clippy --workspace --all-features --all-targets -- -D warnings`
3. `cargo test --workspace`
4. Update `docs/` if you changed a public API or added a feature.

PR descriptions don't need a template. Say what changed and why. Link the issue if there is one.

CI runs the full binding test suite on each PR. You don't need Ruby, Java, PHP, or Elixir set up locally to work on the Rust core.
