//! Bridge between kreuzcrawl's trait-based engine and polyglot bindings.
//!
//! The core [`CrawlEngine`] uses `Arc<dyn Trait>` for pluggable components,
//! which cannot cross FFI boundaries. This module provides a config-only
//! construction path with default implementations, plus async adapter
//! functions that alef can generate bindings for.
